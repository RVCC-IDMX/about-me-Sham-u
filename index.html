                <div>
                    <p>My name is Sam Buccarelli and I am Virginia Tech Graduate
                        and current RVCC Student. </p>

                    <p> I graduated with a degree in Human Nutrition Food and
                        Exercise. I am currently persuing a Computer Support
                        Certificate. </p>

                    <p> I have always enjoyed working with computers and have a
                        good amount experience such as building my own computer
                        and helping friends with bios and boot drive issues.
                    </p>

                    <p> My hope is to be able to use these skills along with the
                        knowledge that I have learned getting my degree to make
                        myself standout and display a wealth of knowledge in the
                        job market. As well as unite work with topics and
                        interests I am passionate about. </p>

                    <p> A few topics I have reserached such as different diets
                        and the affects that each have non alcoholic fatty liver
                        disease and using In-silico analysis to identify
                        pathogenic variants in the human genome. </p>

                    <p>Reserach has always been a major intrest to me and the
                        hunt to find out the whats and the whys of the world.
                        But there is more to me than just school and reserach.
                    </p>

                    <p>Below are a few of my hobbies or interests that I like to
                        do in my spare time. </p>

                <h4>Stacking Context and Z-index</h4>

                <div>

                    <p>Z-index in terms of CSS is the property that sets the
                        layer order of objects
                        when displayed in html. The best way to visualize this
                        concept is looking at a
                        graph that presents with 3 axis (X, Y, Z). The X axis
                        determines the horizontal
                        placement of an object, the Y axis determines the
                        vertical placement of an
                        object, and thus this would mean that the Z axis
                        determines how close or far the
                        object is from the viewpoint. This adds range or depth
                        of objects to their
                        surroundings.</p>

                    <p>In CSS and HTML, the order of objects is usually
                        considered static by default.
                        Meaning that the default order of objects follows the
                        order of how it is
                        written, so the last line or value takes priority
                        through the idea of cascade.
                        However, there are ways to get around the cascade rule
                        and one of those ways
                        revolves around the z-index property. Z-index uses
                        positive or negative integers
                        to determine the value but if there is no set value it
                        defaults to auto as its
                        value. However, this is not the only part that needs to
                        be clarified. Z-index
                        does not work by itself because it requires position to
                        be defined. If no
                        position is defined, then the object is considered
                        static and will just follow
                        normal rules. But with a position defined and a z-index
                        given an integer, this
                        allows different elements to move around each other, and
                        either be seen in front
                        or behind another object in turn creating something
                        known as stacking context.
                        Stacking context can be defined as group of objects that
                        have a common parent
                        (such as a background or another object) and move
                        together on the z-axis via the
                        Z-index.</p>

                    <p>The practical application of stacking and Z-index comes
                        together in visual and
                        artistic choices. For websites it can add visual depth
                        to seemingly flat
                        elements on a 2D media. Certain elements that are
                        controlled via the z-index or
                        with stacking context would be ones that are created
                        with composite layers like
                        those that include opacity or transform tags. Opacity is
                        the easiest to
                        understand as it controls how translucence something is
                        which can help to show
                        that there are different layers of an object as the top
                        layer can vary by being
                        or less translucence to show a lot or very little of the
                        layers beneath it. The
                        same concept can be applied with transform and the idea
                        of creating filters as
                        filters are another form of stacking context as they can
                        apply effects to an
                        object to change or distort but they still work in a
                        stacking context. Another
                        area that stacking context exists is within navigation
                        elements like drop down
                        menus and overlays. Many modern navigation elements like
                        drop down menus open an
                        element that appears over the original field, this
                        element appears because when
                        clicked the z-index for the drop-down menu takes
                        priority over the original page
                        and shows a popout or an extra layer that displays the
                        options that take
                        precedent in display over the main content of a page.
                        These are just a few of
                        the applications of Z-index in relation to stacking
                        context, the topic can go
                        even further when other elements are added such as
                        JavaScript to improve
                        creation, design and further ones creative choices.</p>

                    <p>Below is a small visual example. Cascade order would mean
                        that block 3 should be in front of the other blocks, but
                        do to Z-index that is not the case. The Z-index for
                        block 1 is set to 2 to be in front, while block 2 is set
                        to 0 to be behind both block 1 and block 3. Block 3 is
                        set to 1 so that it is in front of block 2 but behind
                        block 1. I also made block 1 70% opaque to display the
                        stacking context of the 3 blocks by being able to see
                        below block 1. </p>
