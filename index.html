                <h2>Biography: </h2>

                <div>
                    <p>My name is Sam Buccarelli and I am Virginia Tech Graduate
                        and current RVCC Student. </p>

                    <p> I graduated with a degree in Human Nutrition Food and
                        Exercise. I am currently persuing a Computer Support
                        Certificate. </p>

                    <p> I have always enjoyed working with computers and have a
                        good amount experience such as building my own computer
                        and helping friends with bios and boot drive issues.
                    </p>

                    <p> My hope is to be able to use these skills along with the
                        knowledge that I have learned getting my degree to make
                        myself standout and display a wealth of knowledge in the
                        job market. As well as unite work with topics and
                        interests I am passionate about. </p>

                    <p> A few topics I have reserached such as different diets
                        and the affects that each have non alcoholic fatty liver
                        disease and using In-silico analysis to identify
                        pathogenic variants in the human genome. </p>

                    <p>Reserach has always been a major intrest to me and the
                        hunt to find out the whats and the whys of the world.
                        But there is more to me than just school and reserach.
                    </p>

                    <p>Below are a few of my hobbies or interests that I like to
                        do in my spare time. </p>

                <h4>An Excerpt from Dracula </h4>

                <div>

                    <p>"How these papers have been placed in sequence will be
                        made manifest in the
                        reading of them. All needless matters have been
                        eliminated, so that a
                        history almost at variance with the possibilities of
                        later-day belief may
                        stand forth as simple fact. There is throughout no
                        statement of past things
                        wherein memory may err, for all the records chosen are
                        exactly contemporary,
                        given from the standpoints and within the range of
                        knowledge of those who
                        made them."</p>

                    <p>"The castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice.
                        A
                        stone falling from
                        the window would fall a thousand feet without touching
                        anything! As far as
                        the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops, with
                        occasionally a deep rift
                        where there is a chasm. Here and there are silver
                        threads where the rivers
                        wind in deep gorges through the forests."</p>

                    <p>"I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on
                        me. It is destroying
                        my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all
                        sorts of horrible
                        imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my
                        terrible fear in this
                        accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful expanse,
                        bathed in soft
                        yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day."
                    </p>

                    <p>"The morning of 16 May broke bright and cheerful. The sun
                        shone warm and
                        brilliant, and the birds sang sweetly in the trees. The
                        very air seemed full
                        of hope and happiness. I felt that the cloud of gloom
                        which had been hanging
                        over us for so long was lifting, and that we were about
                        to enter upon a new
                        phase of our strange and terrible experience."</p>

                    <p>"We kept on ascending, with occasional periods of quick
                        descent, but in the
                        main always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of
                        the fact that the
                        driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the
                        courtyard of a vast
                        ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray
                        of light, and whose
                        broken battlements showed a jagged line against the
                        moonlit sky."</p>
