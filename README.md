As previously stated this projecct is acculmation of a semester so it was broken down in parts. The top starts with the Nav bar that allows for ease of use to get to a specific section of the website but also is used as a legend for what is to come. From there it leads into the websites logo, small biography and a small list of hobbies. After those sections, an image gallery was added to show interests and hobbies but also to practice adding pictures and media into a website along with how to style them. Beyond that is a blog post about X that accompanies a visual component to provide more context. Also attached is the midterm that was made for this course as well, which dipicts another website that was made in regards to my photography. The visual components of the website ends with a contact us form where a message can be left along with a footer to close out the website.
